K6 by Girfana Labs
K6 is an open-source load testing tool for testing the performance of web applications, APIs and microservices. 
Tests are written in javascript OR typescript and run in goscript for the faster execution rate.

Installation:
k6 has packages for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Alternatively, you can use a Docker container or a standalone binary.
MacOS using Homebrew: brew install k6

POC samples: 
I have created 3 sample tests in this repo SampleGetAPI.js, SamplePostAPI.js and SampleRampingVUs.js

run k6 with this command:
- k6 run filename.js

OR you can comment out the options function and specify the users and duration within the command:
- k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s filename.js

Report:
After the test run has completed a html report will be generated and stored in the base folder.
